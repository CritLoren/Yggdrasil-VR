# What is Yggdrasil VR?

Yggdrasil VR is an ambitious curated mod list that seeks to overhaul and expand Skyrim VR to make it more balanced, challenging, varied, good-looking, and most importantly immersive while making sure it's playable on lower spec configurations with good performance!


## What is installed?

The modlist at the moment has around 1200 mods (too many to count) including all the patching and merges. You can see a full list (including the stuff that is pre-merged on my side that won't show up on your side separately in mo2) at [this link](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/yggdrasil-vr).


## What is different from vanilla?

It adds tons of new spells, locations, dungeons, monsters, bandits, and touches on most facets of gameplay. I have detailed underneath how different types of gameplay styles are affected. It is by no means a "must" to fit into one of these, and I have tried to give enough opportunities at each corner to give more options; however it's a good read to see how your experience might differ from vanilla.

### The Explorer
- Everything is interactable! Well, almost everything, but you won’t notice much of what isn’t.
- Many things are breakable! Barrels, tables, chairs, bookshelves!
- Lots of immersive clutter to loot, collect it or sell it, it’s your choice.
- Explore more ruins, camp with your followers after while you have a drink (with HIGGS) and maybe research some spells.
- Make use of the map and compass to find your way around Skyrim!
- Fast travel using carriages, boats or signs! Next time you pass by a road sign, try pointing at some of the arrows on it!
- Find out more about the lives of Skyrim’s citizens via the added dialogue mods.

### The Builder
- There’s a plethora of placeable furniture & statics, almost every asset that Bethesda has added to Skyrim is available for you to place via the Campfire placing system. The world is your canvas, build whatever you want!
- Collect your materials (via infinite ore veins) or buy them from traders.
- Make use of Decorator Helper to move existing objects or to adjust the placed statics with a finer control so that you can call your place home.

### The Thief
- Lockpicks are limited and lockpicking is harder, this way the lockpicking tree will be more useful to you.
- Knock out your opponents with the new knockout poison!

### The Warrior
- No time for lockpicking? Do you think lockpicks are for plebs? Just smash the lock.
- Knock out your opponents with the pommel of your sword! Enemies will be knocked out if hit at low health, as they’re now at your mercy.
- Tougher enemies are just around the corner. Be prepared to dodge them by crouching at the opportune moment!
- Vampires are now a true menace for Skyrim, you’ll need silver if you want to put an end to them.

### The Mage
- Spell learning is no longer done by simply eating books. Spell learning was nerfed via the use of Spell Research and Spell Tutor to make it more immersive. Spell learning is now your downtime action. Dungeons aren't the best places for academic studies anyway.
- Learning a spell is no longer the finish line. Until you can call yourself a master of a spell you will need to keep its tome in your inventory while you practice it in combat or outside of it. Keeping the book afterwards will let you perfect your mastery of the spell, increasing the effects of the spell.
- Disenchant most artefacts and place their effects on anything else you want (I recommend getting the perk that lets you disenchant items without losing the items, so you don’t lose your precious artefacts).


## How does it look?

Yggdrasil VR may not be the most eye-candy list there is, but I do value not seeing blocky textures and a nice colour
palette. Here are some screens if you’re curious about how Yggdrasil looks like:

# Thank you
This list would not have been possible without the help of the people on the right. It took a great deal of work to get everything working on my side, but without the help of these people, Yggdrasil VR might've ended before it even began:
## EllieMental, QnoisX, Snippygrub, JanuarySnow, Rakanjo, Deadscale, GingasVR... And you!
